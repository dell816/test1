 ⭐ **Real-World ETL Pipeline Example – TD Bank (ADF + Databricks)**

**“Tell me about an ETL process you built at TD using ADF and Databricks.”**

In my current role at TD Bank, one of the key ETL pipelines I worked on involved ingesting large volumes of operational and analytical data from on-prem SQL environments into **Azure Data Lake** and transforming it for downstream analytics teams.

### **1. Source Systems & Data Movement**

The pipeline ingested data from:

* **On-prem SQL Server**
* **Internal Cisco telephony datasets**
* **Legacy data repositories used by analytics and QA teams**

The datasets were large, frequently updated, and required consistent schemas.

### **2. Orchestration – Azure Data Factory**

I used **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** to orchestrate the end-to-end workflow:

* Scheduled incremental ingestion triggers
* Used copy activities to extract from SQL systems
* Implemented parameterized pipelines so the same pipeline could ingest **multiple datasets**, improving maintainability
* Added **retry logic**, logging, and monitoring alerts to guarantee reliability in production

ADF moved the raw data into **bronze (raw) zones** in the data lake.

### **3. Transformation – Azure Databricks & PySpark**

Once the data landed in the lake, **Databricks** handled transformation and quality checks:

* Used **PySpark** to clean, normalize, and merge the data
* Implemented **schema validation** to manage schema drift
* Performed **key transformations** such as:

  * flattening nested structures
  * standardizing timestamps
  * joining reference tables
  * deduplicating large datasets

In one initiative, I developed a **Data Populator Tool (Python + Databricks + Regex)** to automate ingestion preparation, reducing manual transformation time by **~25%**.

### **4. Storage – Delta Lake Architecture**

Transformed data was stored in:

* **Bronze** → Raw ingestion
* **Silver** → Cleaned and validated data
* **Gold** → Aggregated or business-ready tables

Delta capabilities like **ACID transactions, time-travel, and optimized Z-ordering** helped with query performance and traceability — which is critical for regulated data environments like banking.

### **5. Metadata & Governance**

I also built a **Unified Metadata Search Tool** within Databricks:

* Consolidated metadata from Delta tables, Bitbucket, GitHub, and SQL Server
* Enabled developers and analysts to discover datasets more easily
* Strengthened governance and minimized duplicated pipelines

This tool improved operational efficiency and reduced dependency on tribal knowledge.

### **6. Production Support & Monitoring**

As part of L3 support:

* Investigated ingestion failures
* Resolved schema mismatch issues
* Performed root-cause analysis for broken pipelines
* Documented fixes and updated data lineage

This experience is directly aligned with Deloitte’s expectations around **data quality, troubleshooting, and surveillance data reliability**.

Introduction & Goal of the Session

Hey everyone, thanks for being here.

So today I want to talk about a problem we often face when we’re looking for table schemas across different places like Bitbucket, DBFS, Azure SQL, or our Delta tables in SRZ. The current process is slow and manual — we usually have to open different tools, search by eye, pull data into CSV files, compare them, and even then, sometimes we can’t find what we’re looking for. It takes time and can get frustrating.

That’s why I started thinking: what if we build a tool that can help us with this? The idea is, we give it part of a table name or column name, and it automatically searches across all the data sources we care about, and gives us a list of matches. It should save us a lot of time and manual work.

In this session, I’ll show you the basic idea, a diagram of how it works, and how we can use it.

The only challenge I see for now is access — especially when connecting from a Databricks notebook to something like SQL Server. There might be firewalls, tokens, or authentication needed, so we’ll probably need support from other teams like Matthew’s team to get that sorted out. And if not, we can think of other ways to .

نسخه نهایی + اضافه شدن پروموشن، حقوق و L10 (به انگلیسی)

Hi [Manager Name],
I really appreciate you taking the time to meet. Before anything, I want to say something openly — since I joined the team, I’ve always heard that you’re supportive, straightforward, and someone who genuinely looks out for your people. I’ve personally felt that, and that’s why I’m comfortable having this honest conversation.

Since the day I joined the team, there have been ongoing conversations almost every month about layoffs and restructuring.
And we’ve seen strong technical people around us get affected.
With the more recent changes — like offshore resources joining and responsibilities shifting — it naturally creates uncertainty.

So I wanted to ask from your perspective:
How do you see these changes impacting our team and our long-term direction?

(مکث — بذار کامل توضیح بده)

⸻

🟦 مرحله دوم: بحث تکنیکال

The second thing I wanted to discuss is the future of the work in our team.
Since I joined, most of my responsibilities have been support-oriented. I’m trying to grow technically — especially in AI, ML, and engineering work — so I wanted to understand if there will be opportunities for more technical or development-focused projects on our team.

(مکث کن — اینجا معمولاً خودش شروع می‌کنه درباره امکانات تیم حرف زدن)

⸻

🟧 مرحله سوم: اینجا L10 و افزایش حقوق را محترمانه و حرفه‌ای وارد می‌کنی

Depending on that direction, I also wanted to talk about my own growth path.
I’ve been working hard since I joined, and I feel that with my background and experience, I can contribute at a higher level if the opportunity exists.

So I wanted to ask you honestly:
Do you see a path for me to grow to the next level — potentially L10 — or receive a compensation adjustment if I take on more technical or higher-impact work?

I’m not asking for anything immediately; I just want to understand whether that’s a realistic direction within our team.

(این جمله فوق‌العاده حرفه‌ایه: نه فشار میاره، نه مطالبه است → فقط “مسیر” می‌پرسی)

⸻

🟥 مرحله چهارم: اگر مسیر نبود → نقش ML را مطرح کن

If our team isn’t moving toward more technical work or if growth to the next level isn’t possible in the near future, then I want to be transparent with you.

I’ve seen an internal role that aligns very closely with my technical background, especially in ML.
I haven’t applied yet — because I wanted to talk to you first, out of respect.

If I decide to explore it, would you be open to supporting me?
And I want to make sure that doing so won’t negatively affect my position here if things don’t work out.


----------------------------Rob -------------------------------------------
Hey, I just wanted to talk through a couple of things and clear up something from our last conversation.

First, about that comment I made where it sounded like I was saying there’s “no opportunity” here — that was a misunderstanding it might be because of my language . What I meant was that some other teams have really bold projects that get a lot of visibility in AI2 space such as Quarterly hands calls. I didn’t mean to say there’s no opportunity in our team or that I’m not happy here. If it came across the wrong way, I honestly apologize — that wasn’t my intention at all. The second thing that Matthew said, regarding ownership, just wanted to day, I tried my best to cover PES issue and take ownership (you are aware of my attempts for MBNA although some of the task was assigned to Aayush, I helped to get resolved even outside working hour or weekend) to take the initiative for any task is coming from PES team, 

The next thing is related to my career direction. Recently I was browsing LinkedIn and I noticed the Finance team had an opening. The role caught my attention because it connects really well with my previous experience in my ERP and financial systems, and it seems like a place where I could grow, contribute more, and really build out my long-term career path. I reached out to the manager for a quick coffee chat, just to learn more about the role, and the conversation made me feel like it might be a good fit for me. 

To be honest — this isn’t about being unhappy here or applying everywhere. It’s simply that this specific role aligns closely with my background and where I see myself heading in the future. 

Also, you probably remember that last time I mentioned I was hoping to work toward a Level 10 promotion. I understand that these things take time, and you must have had an exceptional project or achievements to reach this Level and I understand how expectations work and what’s needed to get to that level. 

So wanted to be open with you about where my head is at, you know this situation is really hard for me, If you allow me , I want to go , but your support means a lot to me. If I move forward with this opportunity, I really hope I can count on your support and a positive reference. I appreciate everything you’ve done for me, and I want to make sure I leave a good impression and keep a strong relationship with the team.
