 ⭐ **Real-World ETL Pipeline Example – TD Bank (ADF + Databricks)**

**“Tell me about an ETL process you built at TD using ADF and Databricks.”**

In my current role at TD Bank, one of the key ETL pipelines I worked on involved ingesting large volumes of operational and analytical data from on-prem SQL environments into **Azure Data Lake** and transforming it for downstream analytics teams.

### **1. Source Systems & Data Movement**

The pipeline ingested data from:

* **On-prem SQL Server**
* **Internal Cisco telephony datasets**
* **Legacy data repositories used by analytics and QA teams**

The datasets were large, frequently updated, and required consistent schemas.

### **2. Orchestration – Azure Data Factory**

I used **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** to orchestrate the end-to-end workflow:

* Scheduled incremental ingestion triggers
* Used copy activities to extract from SQL systems
* Implemented parameterized pipelines so the same pipeline could ingest **multiple datasets**, improving maintainability
* Added **retry logic**, logging, and monitoring alerts to guarantee reliability in production

ADF moved the raw data into **bronze (raw) zones** in the data lake.

### **3. Transformation – Azure Databricks & PySpark**

Once the data landed in the lake, **Databricks** handled transformation and quality checks:

* Used **PySpark** to clean, normalize, and merge the data
* Implemented **schema validation** to manage schema drift
* Performed **key transformations** such as:

  * flattening nested structures
  * standardizing timestamps
  * joining reference tables
  * deduplicating large datasets

In one initiative, I developed a **Data Populator Tool (Python + Databricks + Regex)** to automate ingestion preparation, reducing manual transformation time by **~25%**.

### **4. Storage – Delta Lake Architecture**

Transformed data was stored in:

* **Bronze** → Raw ingestion
* **Silver** → Cleaned and validated data
* **Gold** → Aggregated or business-ready tables

Delta capabilities like **ACID transactions, time-travel, and optimized Z-ordering** helped with query performance and traceability — which is critical for regulated data environments like banking.

### **5. Metadata & Governance**

I also built a **Unified Metadata Search Tool** within Databricks:

* Consolidated metadata from Delta tables, Bitbucket, GitHub, and SQL Server
* Enabled developers and analysts to discover datasets more easily
* Strengthened governance and minimized duplicated pipelines

This tool improved operational efficiency and reduced dependency on tribal knowledge.

### **6. Production Support & Monitoring**

As part of L3 support:

* Investigated ingestion failures
* Resolved schema mismatch issues
* Performed root-cause analysis for broken pipelines
* Documented fixes and updated data lineage

This experience is directly aligned with Deloitte’s expectations around **data quality, troubleshooting, and surveillance data reliability**.

Introduction & Goal of the Session

Hey everyone, thanks for being here.

So today I want to talk about a problem we often face when we’re looking for table schemas across different places like Bitbucket, DBFS, Azure SQL, or our Delta tables in SRZ. The current process is slow and manual — we usually have to open different tools, search by eye, pull data into CSV files, compare them, and even then, sometimes we can’t find what we’re looking for. It takes time and can get frustrating.

That’s why I started thinking: what if we build a tool that can help us with this? The idea is, we give it part of a table name or column name, and it automatically searches across all the data sources we care about, and gives us a list of matches. It should save us a lot of time and manual work.

In this session, I’ll show you the basic idea, a diagram of how it works, and how we can use it.

The only challenge I see for now is access — especially when connecting from a Databricks notebook to something like SQL Server. There might be firewalls, tokens, or authentication needed, so we’ll probably need support from other teams like Matthew’s team to get that sorted out. And if not, we can think of other ways to .
