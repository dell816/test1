Introduction & Goal of the Session

Hey everyone, thanks for being here.

So today I want to talk about a problem we often face when weâ€™re looking for table schemas across different places like Bitbucket, DBFS, Azure SQL, or our Delta tables in SRZ. The current process is slow and manual â€” we usually have to open different tools, search by eye, pull data into CSV files, compare them, and even then, sometimes we canâ€™t find what weâ€™re looking for. It takes time and can get frustrating.

Thatâ€™s why I started thinking: what if we build a tool that can help us with this? The idea is, we give it part of a table name or column name, and it automatically searches across all the data sources we care about, and gives us a list of matches. It should save us a lot of time and manual work.

In this session, Iâ€™ll show you the basic idea, a diagram of how it works, and how we can use it.

The only challenge I see for now is access â€” especially when connecting from a Databricks notebook to something like SQL Server. There might be firewalls, tokens, or authentication needed, so weâ€™ll probably need support from other teams like Matthewâ€™s team to get that sorted out. And if not, we can think of other ways to .
