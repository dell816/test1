Below are well-written, measurable, and realistic objectives, tailored to:
	•	Your DS&D / Data Science & Data Engineering role
	•	Your actual PES, IVR, MBNA, Databricks, validation, and ID8 achievements
	•	TD’s simplified framework
	•	Your goal to progress toward Level 10

You can copy-paste these directly into MyHR (Workday) and adjust metrics with your manager if needed.

✅ F26 Objectives (Draft)

1. Business Outcomes

Objective:
Deliver high-quality, timely data validation and analytics solutions that improve metric accuracy, productivity, and business decision-making for PES, IVR, and downstream stakeholders.

Key Results / Measures (SMART):
	•	Deliver 100% of assigned PES and IVR DDR validations on time, meeting agreed data quality and completeness standards.
	•	Identify, analyze, and resolve at least 3 high-impact data quality or metric issues (e.g., MBNA, Titan, legacy scorecards, Athena) through root-cause analysis and source tracing.
	•	Develop and maintain production-ready Databricks notebooks (PySpark/SQL) that improve validation efficiency or automation by 20–30% compared to manual processes.
	•	Successfully support new data products or metric rollouts by leading or significantly contributing to validation activities.

Alignment to TD Goals:
Supports disciplined execution, trusted data, and faster insight delivery for business partners.

⸻

2. Risk Culture

Objective:
Strengthen TD’s risk culture by proactively owning data quality, raising issues early, and ensuring transparency, traceability, and governance across analytics and validation processes.

Key Results / Measures (SMART):
	•	Demonstrate “Own It” by independently investigating and resolving complex data issues end-to-end, including legacy and on-prem sources.
	•	Demonstrate “Raise It” by escalating 100% of material data quality, control, or lineage risks with clear evidence and impact assessment.
	•	Demonstrate “Know It” by documenting data sources, limitations, assumptions, and validation logic for all major deliverables.
	•	Contribute to improved governance by enhancing Databricks catalogs, metadata, or documentation to support auditability and downstream reuse.

Alignment to TD Goals:
Protects client and enterprise trust through strong controls, transparency, and responsible data use.

⸻

3. Leadership

Objective:
Demonstrate emerging technical leadership by driving innovation, improving tooling, mentoring peers, and investing in continuous learning to support team capability and future growth.

Key Results / Measures (SMART):
	•	Advance the ID8 “Unified Metadata Search” initiative by:
	•	Delivering a functional MVP or pilot
	•	Partnering cross-functionally (e.g., EDC, DaaS)
	•	Driving adoption by at least one additional team
	•	Actively mentor or support teammates by sharing technical knowledge, documentation, or reusable assets (e.g., notebooks, validation patterns, Git templates).
	•	Complete targeted upskilling aligned with TD priorities (Databricks DE path, AI/ML, DLT, DBT, GitHub Copilot, Agentic AI) and apply learnings to day-to-day work.
	•	Seek and incorporate regular feedback from manager and senior peers to progress toward readiness for Level 10 responsibilities.

Alignment to TD Culture:
Builds a stronger, more capable team while reinforcing accountability, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

⸻

✅ Optional “What Support I Need” (Good for manager discussion)
	•	Regular mentoring and feedback from senior team members to accelerate technical depth and business impact.
	•	Support and prioritization to scale ID8 beyond an idea into a production-ready capability.
	•	Exposure to larger technical ownership or lead-level responsibilities aligned with Level 10 expectations.

⸻

✅ Next Step Suggestion

If you want, I can:
	•	Shorten these to perfectly fit Workday’s character limits
	•	Tune metrics based on DS&D leadership expectations
	•	Rewrite them as OKRs instead of SMART
	•	Help you prep a manager talking script to get buy-in fast
