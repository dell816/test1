Subject: Request for Review – Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP)

Hello HR Team,

I hope you are doing well.

Following a conversation with an HR representative last week regarding the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP), I was advised to submit my request through Employee Data Administration > Letter of Employment Request, as OINP-related requests are reviewed by TD on a case-by-case basis.

I have been with TD since September 2022 and have lived in Canada for nearly five years with my family (my wife and our teenage daughter). During this time, I have consistently extended my work permit each year with the hope of becoming a permanent resident of Canada. The prolonged uncertainty has been stressful for our family, particularly for my daughter, who will be starting university next year and has been emotionally impacted by this situation.

Two years ago, I received an OINP invitation; however, my application was refused due to a missing employer form. Since then, program rules have changed, and employers are now able to support eligible employees directly through the OINP portal. I would like to clarify that this process is not a sponsorship and does not create any employment obligation or responsibility for TD.

I am a loyal and hardworking employee, and I take pride in following TD’s policies, rules, and professional standards. I truly value my role at TD and hope to continue contributing to the organization long-term as a permanent resident of Canada. After consulting with immigration lawyers and RCIC professionals, I was advised that requesting employer support would be the appropriate step.

I respectfully ask if TD would be willing to review my case and consider supporting my OINP application. This support would mean a great deal to my family and would provide much-needed stability after several years of uncertainty.

Please let me know if any additional information or documentation is required. Thank you very much for your time, understanding, and consideration.

Kind regards,
